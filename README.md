# Fake-News-Prediction-Model-Using-ML
Collected a dataset that contains 20000+ news data with a binary output (whether the news is a real one or fake)
this is a label dataset that means supervised learning & binary output that's why i used logistic regression algorithm to
create this model.
Used Libraries to create the model:
1) Numpy
2) Pandas
3) Re (Regular expression)
4) Stopwords from nltk (Eliminate unimportant words from dataset)
5) PorterStemmer from nltk (Convert a word to its root word)
6) TfidVectorizer from sklearn (Convert textual data to neumerical data)
7) LogisticRegression from sklearn

Accuracy of testing data over: 0.95%
